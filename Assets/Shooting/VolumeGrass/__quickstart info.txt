1. Create empty game object and add VolumeGrass.cs script (available from component menu).
   a. Adding nodes - shift click, adding bezier handles - alt click
   b. Shift click on edge will insert node between
   c. Alt+shift click to define arbitrary tesselation points on mesh
   d. Adjust settings and click "Build"
   
2. When adding SetupForGrassRendering script to the camera, choose layers with objects that intersect the grass, keep in mind:
	
   a. make it simple (don't render whole scene into temporary depth buffer, but objects you need to properly intersect grass only)
   b. don't choose layers with grass (which would cause grass to be "self-occluded" and disappear during rendering)

3. You can also use any "flat" mesh (like plane) and use VolumeGrass_CustomMesh.cs script. Correct volume will be constructed with shader attached.

4. To make custom grass billboard textures use a tool (Window/VolumeGrass Tools/Prepare grass texture)

5. Look into VG_Base.cginc - there is a tiny configuration section for options that are not available in material inspector. You can adjust IBL skyshop integration and color space.
